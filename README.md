# Forensic Analysis Report: Nocatland Case

## Overview
This repository contains the forensic analysis report prepared as part of a Digital Forensics lab exercise. The task involved investigating a smartphone to uncover evidence of illegal activities under the fictional laws of Nocatland.

## Objectives
- Identify and analyze photos portraying real cats, including their origin (captured or downloaded).
- Detect machine-generated images and quantify them.
- Investigate instances of cat petting, including details such as who, when, where, and how.
- Identify attempts to obstruct justice by hiding or destroying evidence.
- Highlight any suspected accomplices based on digital artifacts.

## Methodology
1. **Data Acquisition**: Extracted data from the suspect's smartphone while preserving data integrity.
2. **Photo Analysis**: Examined metadata to determine photo origins and categorized them as real, downloaded, or machine-generated.
3. **Behavioral Analysis**: Reconstructed timelines to identify instances of cat petting and associated details.
4. **Obstruction Detection**: Analyzed artifacts for evidence of tampering or intentional data deletion.
5. **Reporting**: Compiled findings into a structured forensic report addressing all investigative questions.

## Tools Used
- Metadata analysis tools for photo origin identification.
- Timeline reconstruction techniques for behavioral analysis.
- Keyword search and artifact correlation for accomplice identification.

## Report Structure
The forensic report includes:
- **Photo Analysis**: Details on real, downloaded, and machine-generated images.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Insights into cat petting incidents with timestamps and locations.
- **Obstruction Attempts**: Evidence of tampering or data deletion.
- **Accomplice Identification**: Potential links to other individuals based on digital evidence.
